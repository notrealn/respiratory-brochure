          Here we have many exciting attractions and diagrams of the respiratory system. Go click on
          the stuff in the bar on top of the screen.

        <p>Warning: this website was not built for phones and stuff will probably break</p>
        <p>
          Also if you reload the page on something that isnt the homepage, it might break. If that
          happens just go back to https://notrealn.github.io/respiratory-brochure/. I could fix this
          but im too lazy
